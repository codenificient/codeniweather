## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (3 files)

- **WeatherAPI Tests**: API methods, data formatting, forecast processing
- **GeolocationService Tests**: Browser geolocation, IP fallback, error handling
- **StorageService Tests**: Local storage operations, data persistence

### Integration Tests (1 file)

- **WeatherContext Tests**: State management, component interactions, API integration

### End-to-End Tests (1 file)

## 🌤️ Forecast Feature Testing

The 7-day forecast feature is thoroughly tested:

### API Integration

- OpenWeatherMap 5-day forecast API calls
- Data processing from 3-hour intervals to daily averages
- Error handling and timeout management

### Data Processing

- Temperature range calculations (high/low)
- Precipitation probability averaging
- Weather condition selection
- Rain/snow amount summation

### UI Components

- ForecastPanel component display
- Weather icons and temperature ranges
- Precipitation indicators
- Responsive design and animations

### State Management

- Forecast data caching in WeatherContext
- Automatic refresh on location changes
- Loading states and error handling

## 📊 Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)

- **Environment**: jsdom (for React components)
- **Coverage Threshold**: 80% for all metrics
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds per test
- **Setup File**: `tests/setup.js`

### Test Setup (`tests/setup.js`)
